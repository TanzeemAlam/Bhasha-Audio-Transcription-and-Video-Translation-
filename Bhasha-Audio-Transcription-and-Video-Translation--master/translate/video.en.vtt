00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
I want to solve some problems from

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.470
section 9.3 and remember these were the

3
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.799
problems that will be on your final but

4
00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.610
we're not on any of the earlier tip

5
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.280
third problem says 5% of the area under

6
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.900
a normal curve between the mean and

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.400
given number of standard deviations

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.150
front of me and this is problem number

9
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.189
158 actually from the practice final and

10
00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.070
we wanted to point eight three standard

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.109
deviations from the mean now when it

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.820
says standard deviations from the mean

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.739
you know you're working with a Z value

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.160
the Z's those z-scores our stamp

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.739
measures a standard deviation from the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.469
mean now you don't necessarily have to

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.100
draw a picture but in my mind it'll be a

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.050
lot clearer make a lot more sense if you

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.469
do you have a normal curve and you're

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.180
measuring standard deviations from the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.830
mean now for a standard normal

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.240
those Z values of Z scores the mean is

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.920
always zero that's the mean so you want

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.140
it to be point eight three twenty three

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.280
let's say is here

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.820
and we wanted to be point eight three

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.060
best to the right standard deviations

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.690
from the mean

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.550
remember the Z values are measured in

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.720
standard deviation so point three means

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.330
less than one standard deviation from

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.729
the mean so what we're actually looking

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.920
for is that area that I've shaded here a

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.720
little better than that maybe also keep

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.640
in mind at the table that you're using

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.399
to look these things up give values to

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.399
the left so for example here looking at

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.130
these table values if you ever forget

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.950
that the whether they measure to the

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.450
left of the ride you can look at the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.640
table itself it shades in area to the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.010
left of a particular Z value so in this

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.769
table the values are always the area

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.600
under the curve from negative infinity

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.370
all the way up to the V Bay in other

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.150
words to the left

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.430
and when I look up

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.290
point eight three in that table it's

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.959
gonna give me the value from point eight

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.909
three all the way back and that's not

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.640
what I want but if I look up zero it's

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.260
going to give me the value from here on

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.540
back and if I subtract the two it's

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.189
going to give me the value in between in

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.709
other words just as we talked about in

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.680
class when you're finding the area

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:11.129
between two Z values you simply take the

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.129
bigger number the one to the right and

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.620
look up the probability to this less

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.099
than that from the table and then you

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.530
take up take the rightmost number I'm

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.180
excuse me the leftmost number which in

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.329
this case is zero and subtract the two

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.209
so the probability Z is less than point

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.040
eight three is all the way back here the

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.689
probability Z is less than zero is here

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:38.549
and she's subtract the two you get in

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.590
between so what you need to remember is

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.200
that when you're finding the value the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.599
probability of Z being between two

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.849
numbers you take the bigger number look

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.590
it up in the table smaller never look at

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.560
the table subtract the two result well

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.139
let's do that now keep in mind at the

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.579
table I'm going to bring him a little

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.500
tighter so you can see these numbers a

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.250
little better I hope

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.319
Oh

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.550
I'm looking up 0.83 well those are

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.220
negatives so I want to go to the other

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.569
page those are negative now looking at

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:36.800
0.83 so you go down to 0.8 which is this

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.190
row and you're going to 0.8 3 the first

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.990
column if you look at the top starts

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.960
with 0 0 1 2 3 all the way so if you're

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.470
looking at point 8 3 then you go to the

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.970
point 8 row and go 0 1 2 3 so if you get

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.460
this number right here point nine point

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.310
seven nine six seven point seven nine

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:05.330
six seven remember you got that in the

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.759
table by looking up the rightmost number

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.190
then you look up the leftmost number

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.409
which is 0 you go to the table look

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:18.460
again well 0 0 is right here is point 5

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.570
so the probability that Z is less than 0

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:30.349
is point 5 and subtract and you end up

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:33.110
with if you do that subtraction point

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.520
two nine six seven they ask for the

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.340
percent of the area so if you want to

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.969
change that to a percent that would be

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:47.120
twenty nine point six seven percent

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.469
remember we changed something to a

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:49.940
percentage you move the decimal two

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.000
places to the right

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.259
so before I forgot the pen back

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:01.039
so as it turns out about twenty nine

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:02.989
point six seven percent of the area is

00:06:02.989 --> 00:06:06.189
between those two values

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:09.859
simple enough also I would say this

00:06:09.859 --> 00:06:12.199
without saying you have to do it this

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:14.449
way when you're using Z values and you

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:17.439
get a zero it's always going to be 0.5

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:19.249
regardless of whether you look at the

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:22.249
table or not because the standard normal

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:24.169
has a mean of zero in a symmetric half

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:25.699
the areas to the left and half there is

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:27.619
the right so I knew as soon as I saw

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:30.319
this zero right here that the

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:32.659
probability uncollected point five yeah

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:34.009
you can still look it up if you don't
121
00:06:34,009 --> 00:00:00,000
want to remember that
